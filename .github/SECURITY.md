# **Reporting Security Issues**

I take security issues seriously.
Vulnerabilities can be disclosed in private:

- [GitHub advisories](https://github.com/caffeine-addictt/portfolio/security)
- `caffeine.02` on Signal (if immediate attention is needed)

---

I appreciate your efforts to disclose your findings responsibly
and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Thanks
